## Management Principles

### Decision-Making Framework

### Delegation Guidelines
When delegating tasks:

- Track progress at regular intervals

## Approval Workflows

### Budget Approvals
Authority levels:
- <$10K: Auto-approve (department budget)

- >$50K: Requires Finance + Manager approval

When reviewing budget requests:
- [ ] Verify budget availability
- [ ] Validate business justification
- [ ] Check alignment with priorities
- [ ] Document approval rationale

### Time-Off Approvals
Considerations:
- Team coverage (ensure adequate coverage)

- Notice period (2+ weeks preferred)

### Hiring Approvals
Process:
1. Verify headcount budget
2. Review job description

## Team Management

### Weekly Sync
Agenda template:

### 1-on-1s
Monthly 1-on-1 structure:

### Performance Management
Quarterly check-ins:

### Escalation Protocol
When to escalate:
