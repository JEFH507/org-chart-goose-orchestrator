# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to goose-org-twin.

## Workflow
- Branching: feature branches per workstream (see README and docs/architecture)
- Commits: Conventional Commits (see docs/conventions/commit-style.md)
- PRs: Use the PR template, link relevant ADRs, include testing notes
- Reviews: 1+ reviewer, no force-push to shared branches

## ADRs
Architecture Decision Records live in `docs/adr/` (0001–0016 for Phase 0). Reference ADRs in issues and PRs when applicable.

## DCO/CLA
For now, acknowledgements follow repository license terms. If a DCO or CLA is introduced, we will document the flow here.

## Local-only files
Do not commit local secrets, tokens, or `.env.ce`. See `.gooseignore`.

## Reporting issues
