  Org-Chart Orchestrated AI Framework — MVP
    Goals
      Deliver role-based assistants mapped to org chart
      Enforce privacy-by-design with least-privilege and audit
      Standardize workflows with reusable recipes
      Flexible deployment (desktop, endpoint, org-wide, hybrid)
      Governance and operations visibility (cost, performance)
    Features
      P0 (MVP)
        Role onboarding: OIDC SSO (Keycloak in CE) import org, assign role profiles
        Desktop agent with local privacy guard (mask-and-forward)
        Cross-agent task routing and approvals (HTTP-only)
        Audit trail: structured logs and session history (OTLP/OTel-ready optional); ndjson export
        Model routing: cost-aware; local guard via Ollama + rules
        AuthN/AuthZ: OIDC SSO; short-lived JWT for services; RBAC/ABAC; extension allowlists
        Secrets: Vault + KMS (CE: Vault OSS; SaaS: managed Vault); desktop uses OS keychain/sops
        Platforms: macOS/Linux; optional tiny controller (Ubuntu)
      P1 (Post-MVP)
        SCIM provisioning (optional)
        mTLS and stronger agent-to-agent auth
        Data residency controls and compliance packs
        Windows support and Kubernetes packaging
        Optional message bus (NATS/Redis/Kafka) via BusProvider adapters
        Dashboards: Prometheus/Loki/Grafana (or vendor via OTel)
    Constraints
      Budget: $200–$500/month (MVP)
      Timeline: 6–8 weeks solo; quarter target
      Performance: P50 < 15s, P95 < 60s; interactive P50 ≤ 5s
      Availability: 99.5% orchestrator target
      Platform: Postgres metadata; object storage; standards (MCP/ACP)
      Compliance: privacy-by-design; auditable logs; retention configurable
    Risks
      Privacy guard accuracy vs. utility
      Integration sprawl and maintenance burden
      Latency and cost from multi-agent orchestration
      Agent communication security and policy enforcement gaps
      Adoption and change-management friction
    Assumptions
      Single-tenant per org; deployable in customer VPC or on-prem
      OIDC for SSO; SCIM optional
      Deterministic pseudonymization per-tenant keys
      Models: local and cloud; cost downshift allowed
      Initial focus roles: Finance, Marketing, Engineering
      Audit log default retention 90 days
