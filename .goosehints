# Goose Hints — org-chart-goose-orchestrator

-Do not create unnecessary documents, if its a simple summary show it in screen, unless is necessary documentation or user requested. When in doubt, ask.
-Respect full integration testing and backward compatibility validation between phases, do not defer to future phases, stack must work end-to-end.
-When close to context window of current session limits, stop and update progress logs (/Docs/tests/) and update current phase state json, and checklist files( /PM Phases/Phase-x)

For Git SSH Keys request use:
Git Remote Policy — SSH-first with GNOME askpass:
- Ask only for values that are missing and required for the requested action.
- Propose sensible defaults (e.g., base_branch=main; use current branch; infer tags from VERSION_PINS.md).
- Prefer SSH for remotes. If the SSH key isn’t loaded, prefer GNOME askpass to avoid interactive loops:
  ```bash
  export DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0}
  export SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force
  SSH_ASKPASS="$(command -v ssh-askpass-gnome || command -v ssh-askpass || true)"
  if [ -n "$SSH_ASKPASS" ]; then setsid -w ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 < /dev/null; fi
  ```
For Sudo requests use: Always use GUI ask prompt instead of waiting for input on terminal.

Owner identity and Git
- GitHub user: JEFH507 (Javier)
- Git identity: Javier / 132608441+JEFH507@users.noreply.github.com
- Remote (SSH): git@github.com:JEFH507/org-chart-goose-orchestrator.git
- Default branch: main
- Merge policy: conventional commits; squash merges for PRs; link PRs in progress log

GitHub MCP / workflow
- Use GitHub MCP and SSH-based git operations
- Branch naming: feature/*, fix/*, chore/*, docs/*, build/*
- PR practice: small, reviewable changes; CI must be green before merge
- Fine grain tokens permission:

Environment Configuration
- deploy/compose/.env.ce contains sensitive configuration (Keycloak URLs, JWT tokens, Vault tokens, service endpoints)
- File is .gooseignored (never committed to git - security requirement)
- If you need specific values (CONTROLLER_URL, JWT tokens, Keycloak URLs, etc.):
  - ASK USER to provide or create the specific value needed
  - DO NOT attempt to read the file (it's ignored)
  - User will provide exact value to use
- Create .env.example files (no real secrets) for documentation

Pause/Resume protocol on phase prompts (Technical Project Plan/PM Phases/)
- Phase state JSON and progress logs are mandatory updates after each milestone
- State JSON path per phase (example): Technical Project Plan/PM Phases/Phase-1/Phase-1-Agent-State.json
- Progress log: docs/tests/phase1-progress.md (append timestamped entries with branch/PR context)
